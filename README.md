# AWS Events

Q&A with AWS Events.

This Git repository hosts a website that offers a comprehensive Q&A platform for a video repository. The website enables users to pose questions and receive answers related to the complete Reinvent 2022 playlist. The main advantage of utilizing video-based lectures for querying information lies in the fact that these videos provide current and integrated knowledge, covering various services and real-world use cases from customers. This surpasses the traditional official documentation by offering up-to-date insights and a holistic understanding of the subject matter.
